0.1.1
=====
Clean up verbose output messages

The output from the "--verbose" flag with the "test" functionality is slightly more useful. For unparseable files, the "--verbose" flag will print information from the exception that was raised as a result of the parsing attempt. This information allows the user to fix the BibTeX file such that it can be parsed.

0.1.0
=====
First release with minimal functionality

* Implement "test" functionality to test if a specified file(s) contains parseable BibTeX.


0.0.2
=====
Unofficial release. This version was created in the repo to differentiate it from the most alpha release of all, 0.0.1.
